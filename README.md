#Note 1
As I was not sure whether repository "me50/KaziSagar" is only for submitting the project or I can also use this for version control purpose, I created a repository of my own to perform version control. Here is the repository link:
https://github.com/KaziSagar/project0

#Note 2
I've tried to fulfills all of the requirements of projwcr0 but it was not possible for me to compile scss files on my own. Even after installing scss, the git bash showed an error while trying to compile scss files.
