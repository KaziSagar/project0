                  <p>It required me some audacity to write this post as I'm asking you my fellow NSU mates to reconsider enrolling for the upcoming summer semester.
The semester taking place online is not the prime concern, What's more concerning is where our situation as a nation and as well as individuals might stand in the next few months during this pandemic.
A health emergency might arrive for any of us at any particular time during this pandemic, and it can very much be possible that for some of us, money even as less as ten thousand may seem extremely difficult to manage in a short period.
What I'm trying is to establish the fact that at this moment, the value of money you are going to spend is much higher than the education you're going to receive in return.
You might debate that three months of your life is going to get wasted if you don't continue with the classes, but you too know that there are enormous ways you can make use of the free time you will get. You could try developing some actual skills or hobbies that might help you someday.
I hope no one would take it otherwise, I, as a well-wisher urging you all just to reconsider.</p>
