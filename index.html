                  <p>Life is a constant quest for happiness. From the very beginning of life till one's last breath, every human being, perhaps everything that has life keeps searching for happiness. Not that happiness cannot be found, it can be, but however, it is very difficult to retain.</p>
                  <p>The concept of happiness is abstract as the sense of happiness differs from person to person. Some would say money brings happiness while others would argue that money can't buy happiness. Again, some would put love above all sources of happiness.</p>
                  <p>What I personally have experienced in life so far is that when it becomes possible to start finding happiness in small things, life becomes much easier.</p>
