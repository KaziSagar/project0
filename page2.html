                    <p>If I make a list of all the possible sources of happiness I could imagine of, the list them according to their priority, it would be very short and it certainly would include the followings only:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Kindness</li>
                        <li>Love</li>
                        <li>Friendship</li>
                        <li>Traveling</li>
                        <li>Money</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>The reason why I put kindness on top of all is that, of all the happiness that I have experienced in life so far, the best form of happiness I heartfelt is while helping the poor and the ones that are in extreme need. The feeling of happiness at those times was so strong that I feel like demoting my entire life for the sake of humanity.</p>
                <p>Love is the following most precious source of happiness because the love of parents is so immense that according to Islam, after the worship of ALLAH (SWT), the next duty is respecting your parents. Beloved Prophet Muhammad (SA) when once asked by a man "Who in this world deserves the maximum love and comparison?", replied - "Your mother". And what I have realized is seeing mother smile brings the pure most happiness in life.</p>
                <p>Again, loving and being loved by the soulmate is brings peace of mind and heart.</p>
                <p>Friends are the ones whom we have by our side in both happy and sad moments of life. Friends are the ones on whom we can rely on and share everything that we are going through in life. They help us forget our extreme sorrows even if that's for a limited period.</p>
